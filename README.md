## Hajime (始め) Node

My starter stack for new node based sites.   At the moment, I generally like the things in this stack. If you also like the things in this stack, you should use this and we should become friends. If you do not like the things in this stack, then you should probably not use this, but we could still be friends because I'm generally a likable person.

## Stack
- Node
- Gulp
- CoffeeScript
- React / Flux
- Browserify
- Stylus / Nib
- Jade
- Mocha

## Dev

Run `gulp` in the app directory.  It will run the express server, watch for changes in the assets directory and automatically compile, browserify, and create a final `app.js` and `app.css` file in the public directory.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run any tests under Mocha in the test directory.  Use `mocha.opts` to set any [Mocha flags](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#usage) that are important to you.
